 In the "Applied Data Science Capstone" course, learners are tasked with a real-world project centered around the analysis of space exploration data, particularly focusing on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches. The main question addressed in this project revolves around predicting the success or failure of the first-stage landing of the Falcon 9 rocket.
Specifically, I utilize data science skills to analyze various factors and historical data related to Falcon 9 launches, such as launch location, mission outcome, and technical specifications. The goal is to build predictive models that can accurately determine whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after a launch.
